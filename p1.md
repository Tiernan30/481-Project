# P1: User Research

## Project Idea (Alan)

Our project consists of creating an app to help users of Fabrication Laboratories (Fab Labs) with time management problems involving equipment scheduling. This idea was inspired by Fab Lab user in Calgary who delayed his own project due to the lack of a scheduling system. To increase the efficiency of Fab Labs, our app will offer features which include, but are not limited to, helping the users check the availability of different equipment, scheduling usage of equipment and providing a list of ongoing projects in Fab Labs. The main target are current Fab Lab users and people who will potentially develop their projects in a Fab Lab. We expect users to take advantage of the equipment scheduling function in our app to reduce unproductivity and time management problems. This app will be helpful at Fab Lab locations with high traffic and to connect potential developers with other Fab Lab users. Our app will effectively improve users’ time management by organizing the usage of machinery even with a limited availability from Fab Lab.


## Stakeholders and Users (Jared)

Lab Owner/Supervisor:

The system could be used by the lab owner/supervisor to maintain a sense of order to their lab, ensuring that there are fewer conflicts and easier resolution of conflicts regarding the need of specific machines or workstations.  This would potentially allow for an increase in desire to use the space, as the stigma of not being able to use the machine you need when you go to the space would be removed.

Students:(May need to change/add undergrad vs grad)  (include expected knowledge/experience)

The design of the system incorporates the users as those that use the various machinery in the FabLab.  If someone (a student) is using the lab, they have a stake in this system, as knowing what machines or workstations are available ahead of time reduces the amount of time wasted.  The potential for scheduling also allows for users to better conserve their time, as well as to meet with other users to discuss or learn about their projects.

Faculty:
The faculty would use the system in much the same way as students, with the added notion of supervising needs.  The faculty could use it themselves, if they’re performing their own independent research project.  Alternatively, they could use the app to both schedule and oversee their students working on their projects, or reserve a specific machine or workstation for use in their projects.


## User Research Methods (Jay)

For our project, we have used three user research methods. 

The first method is Interview. Since none of us has been to any fabrication laboratories yet, so the best way to know about fab labs is to interview a person who has experience with fab labs. It is important to get information and suggestions from people who have worked in fab labs. 

The second method is observation. We observed the fab lab in math science building, watched graduate students doing experiments in it, and took several photos about the lab. This method is useful to see what people actually do in fab labs, rather than just get information from what they said.

The third method is secondary research. We searched published articles, papers and online resources to help us on developing the design ideas. It is a useful and efficient way to ground our observation and to develop a point of view on our design.


### User Research Method 1: Interview (Jared)

Summary of findings:

Through the course of the interview we found that much of the social aspect happened organically, so our original notions of how scheduling might be used changed. Users often will see another user working on something and casually approach to learn and discuss the project, out of curiosity if nothing else.  We also discovered that, unless there is either a nondisclosure agreement in place or some competition for ideas at stake, information is mostly freely shared among users. 

Probably the biggest “bottleneck” in terms of efficient use of the space was found to be the limited number of machines, specifically the 3D printers.  Due to the limit on these machines, we found that users had some anxiety about using the lab all the time because they had no way of knowing if the machine they needed was available or not.  Specifically with the 3D printers, one task could sometimes take up to 12 hours.  On top of that, sometimes finished tasks are left in the printer, and it was unknown whether it was safe to move those projects without damaging them.  

Our subject thought that an app that both allowed for scheduling and remote access to see if a particular machine was available would be useful, however for scheduling everyone using the lab would need to be using the scheduler or else it would not help.
